#Abstract
In this project, a reliable and inexpensive wireless collision avoidance system was designed for vehicles
traversing roads in high speeds. Miniature wireless cars in an indoor traffic model are used to
simulate real vehicles movements. Several experiments were done to make the car movement reliable.
The selected localization system keeps track of each car’s movement. Each car’s speed and steer is
adjusted by the collision avoidance system, and it is done through sending control commands with
regards to the cars location information obtained from the localization system.
